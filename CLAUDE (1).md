# CLAUDE.md — Metis Project Intelligence File
> Single source of truth for Claude Code sessions. Paste this file at the start of every session.
> Update the MODULE STATUS TABLE and ACTIVE MODULE STATE after every session.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. **Starting a session**: Tell Claude which module you're working on and paste this file. Claude will read the module status, pick up where you left off, and begin with a brainstorm/refinement phase before writing code.
2. **Session contract**: Every session ends with a skeleton that is *runnable* — routes registered, UI screens navigable, no broken imports — even if features are stubs.
3. **Ending a session**: Ask Claude to "update the module state block" and paste the output back into this file before closing.
4. **Brainstorm mode**: Say "let's brainstorm [module]" and Claude will ask clarifying questions before writing a single line of code.
5. **Never skip the skeleton rule**: If a session ends early, the module must at minimum have its router/page registered and returning a 200/placeholder.

## WHAT METIS IS

- Role-based web platform: **Student / Teacher / Admin**
- **Smart Attendance**: QR + GPS + face verification, anti-proxy
- **AI Learning Engine**: RAG tutor per student, knowledge graph, personalised paths
- **AI Insights Engine**: Proactive teacher alerts, risk detection, intervention support
- **Communication**: Announcements, direct messages, notification system
- **Marks & Assessment**: CIE/SEE entry, grade computation, performance history
- **Content Management**: Material uploads → auto-ingested into AI knowledge base

## WHAT METIS IS NOT
- Generic ERP or SAP clone
- Basic CRUD portal
- Prototype — everything is written to be deployable and defensible

## FRONTEND PHILOSOPHY — MVP PHASE

```
CURRENT PHASE: Bare-bones functional UI. Every screen and feature works. Zero design polish.
FUTURE PHASE:  Visual redesign using Claude Design / Figma / other tools AFTER all features are verified.

Rules Claude must follow for ALL frontend work in this phase:

UI RULES (non-negotiable during MVP):
  ✅ Every feature and data point from the screen inventory MUST be present and functional
  ✅ Use shadcn/ui base components only — no custom styling beyond what shadcn provides
  ✅ Layout: simple top nav + sidebar + content area. No creative layouts.
  ✅ No custom color palettes, gradients, animations, or decorative elements
  ✅ No pixel-tweaking or spacing obsession — default Tailwind spacing is fine
  ✅ Tables for tabular data, forms for input, cards for grouped info — pick the obvious element
  ✅ Every button must do something (even if it calls a stub endpoint)
  ✅ Every form must validate and submit (even if backend returns mock data)
  ✅ Loading states: simple spinner or "Loading..." text — nothing fancy
  ✅ Error states: plain red text message — nothing fancy
  ✅ Mobile responsive enough to not break — not optimised

UI NON-GOALS (explicitly deferred to redesign phase):
  ❌ Do NOT spend time on colour schemes or brand identity
  ❌ Do NOT build custom components when shadcn has one
  ❌ Do NOT add hover effects, transitions, or micro-interactions
  ❌ Do NOT try to match any design mockup or visual reference
  ❌ Do NOT refactor working UI to look better — move to next feature instead

COMPONENT STRATEGY:
  - shadcn/ui: Button, Input, Select, Table, Card, Dialog, Tabs, Badge, Form, Toast
  - Data display: use <Table> — do not build custom list views
  - Navigation: use a plain sidebar with links — do not build a custom nav system
  - Charts: recharts with default styles — no custom theming
  - Icons: lucide-react defaults

HANDOFF CONTRACT (what gets handed to redesign tools later):
  - All pages exist with correct data flowing through them
  - All API calls wired to real endpoints
  - Component boundaries are clean (easy to restyle without logic changes)
  - No styling logic mixed into data-fetching or business logic
  - Components accept data as props — styles are purely in className strings (easy to swap)
```

## ARCHITECTURE — 6 LAYERS

```
L1  CLIENT      Student PWA | Teacher PWA | Admin Web | Mobile Attendance App
                → Next.js 14 App Router. /student /teacher /admin sub-apps.

L2  GATEWAY     API Gateway (rate limit, routing) | WebSocket Server | Auth Service
                → Single entry point. Auth validated here before forwarding.

L3  CORE SVCS   M1 User | M2 Academic | M3 Attendance | M4 Marks |
                M5 Comms | M6 Content | M9 Analytics
                → FastAPI modular routers. REST internally, Redis pub/sub for async.

L4  AI LAYER    M7 Learning Engine | M8 Insights + Face Verify | LLM Orchestrator
                → Separate Python services. Isolated for independent redeployment.

L5  DATA        PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Qdrant (vectors) | NetworkX→Neo4j (graph) |
                Redis (cache/queue) | Cloudflare R2 (files)

L6  INFRA       Vercel (frontend) | Render (backend) | Railway (AI services) |

## EVENT BUS — INTER-MODULE COMMUNICATION

```
Sync:   REST via internal API calls (request/response flows)
Async:  Redis pub/sub (non-blocking, no module imports another's models)

Event                  Publisher    Subscribers
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
attendance.marked      M3           M8 (update risk), M9 (analytics)
marks.updated          M4           M8 (re-rank alerts), M9 (analytics)
material.uploaded      M6           M7 (start ingestion)
user.enrolled          M1           M2 (add to batch), M7 (init graph)
insight.generated      M8           M5 (trigger teacher notification)
session.created        M2           M3 (open QR window)
ingestion.complete     M7           M9 (analytics)
notification.queued    M5           (delivery workers)
```

---

## DATA LAYER RULES (apply to every module)

```
Multi-tenancy:  Every table has college_id. Query ALWAYS includes WHERE college_id = ?
Soft deletes:   deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL on all tables. Filter WHERE deleted_at IS NULL.
Audit trail:    Sensitive writes → insert row in audit_logs (actor_id, action, old_val, new_val, ts)
Timestamps:     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(), updated_at auto-trigger
Face data:      NEVER stored. Only verification_confidence FLOAT in attendance_records.
Naming:         snake_case everywhere. Foreign keys: {table_singular}_id.
```

### M3 — Attendance Service
**Owner LLM**: Claude
**Depends on**: M1 (student), M2 (session), M8 (face verify)
**Publishes**: `attendance.marked`, `attendance.anomaly_detected`

```
Anti-proxy design — 3 independent layers:
  Layer 1: QR token = signed JWT (session_id + GPS centroid + expiry + nonce + HMAC-SHA256)
           Regenerates visually every 90s. Server validates signature + expiry.
  Layer 2: GPS — haversine distance from classroom centroid. Threshold: 100m. Flagged not rejected.
  Layer 3: Face — live frame → M8 (DeepFace FaceNet) → match/no-match. Frame discarded immediately.
  Anti-replay: device fingerprint + one-submit-per-device-per-session enforced.

Attendance state machine:
  PENDING → OPEN → SUBMITTED → VERIFIED → RECORDED
                             ↘ FLAGGED (manual teacher review)
  CLOSED (session ended, no further submissions)

**Consumes**: `material.uploaded`, `user.enrolled`

```
RAG ingestion pipeline (triggered by material.uploaded):
  1. Extract: PDF → pdfplumber | PPTX → python-pptx | YouTube → youtube-transcript-api
  2. Clean: strip headers/footers, fix encoding, normalise whitespace
  3. Chunk: recursive splitter, chunk_size=512 tokens, overlap=64 tokens
  4. Embed: MiniLM-L6-v2 (local, zero cost), 384-dim
  5. Store: Qdrant collection per course, payload: {material_id, chunk_index, topic_tags, course_id, college_id}
  6. Index: HNSW, ef_construction=200, m=16

AI tutor interaction flow:
  1. Embed student query (MiniLM)
  2. Qdrant top-5 retrieval from enrolled courses

**Publishes**: `insight.generated`, `verification.result`
**Consumes**: `attendance.marked`, `marks.updated`, `material.uploaded`

```
Face verification design:
  - DeepFace FaceNet backbone
  - Liveness: MediaPipe Face Mesh blink/head-turn challenge (on-device, no video transmitted)
  - Flow: live frame → HTTPS → M8 → fetch stored embedding → cosine similarity → result → discard all
  - NEVER stored: submitted frame, live embedding
  - Stored ONLY: verification_confidence FLOAT in attendance_records

Risk signal model:
  Signal               Measurement                    Impact
  Attendance rate      Per subject, rolling 14d       Low → high urgency
  Attendance trend     Improving/declining 4 weeks    Declining → medium urgency
  Marks trajectory     Last 2 vs class average        Both below avg → high urgency
  Tutor engagement     Days since last AI interaction >7 days → low urgency
  Tutor topic gaps     Concepts not in graph          Large gaps before exam → medium
  Message response     No reply to teacher in 48h     Flagged

ML stack: XGBoost (risk scoring), rule engine (insight ranking), FaceNet (verification)
Max alerts per teacher per day: 5 (ranked by urgency)

## PRIVACY & COMPLIANCE (DPDP Act 2023)

```
Consent:           Explicit required before face biometric collection. Opt-out available
                   (fallback: teacher manual mark).
Purpose limit:     Face data only for attendance verification.
Data minimisation: Frame used for verification → immediately discarded. Embedding not stored.
Right to access:   Students request all personal data via Privacy Centre in app.
Right to erasure:  Student-initiated. Anonymised analytics retained for institutional reporting.
Breach notif:      Report to Data Protection Board within 72 hours.
Data fiduciary:    The college (BMSCE) is fiduciary. Metis is data processor → DPA agreement needed.

Face data technical policy:
  Enrolled photo → FaceNet embedding → stored AES-256 encrypted in users table.
  Decryption key: environment variable (NOT in database).
  Attendance submission: live frame → M8 → cosine similarity → result returned → frame + live embedding DELETED FROM MEMORY.
  Persisted: attendance_records.verification_confidence FLOAT only.
```

## SESSION PROTOCOL

### Starting a session
```
Tell Claude:
  "I am working on [MODULE NAME]. Here is the CLAUDE.md. [paste file]"
  
Claude will:
  1. Read module status table — identify what's done, what's not
  2. Read the active module state block below
  3. Open with: "Before I write any code, let me confirm the plan for this session..."
  4. Brainstorm/refine with you (questions, edge cases, design decisions)
  5. Write a session plan: what will be built, what will be skeleton vs full
  6. Build — skeleton first, then fill features
  7. End with runnable code + updated module state block for you to paste back
```

### Session contract (Claude must honour these)
```
✅ Skeleton rule: Module router/pages MUST be registered and returning 200/placeholder by session end
✅ No broken imports: every import must resolve
✅ No orphan code: every new file must be referenced somewhere
✅ Schema first: DB migrations written before service code
✅ Event contracts first: publish/subscribe wiring before business logic
✅ Brainstorm before code: at least 3 clarifying questions answered before first line
✅ One module per session: do not bleed into another module's territory
✅ Update state block: always produce updated ACTIVE MODULE STATE at end

UI CONTRACT (enforced every session, no exceptions):
✅ All features listed in the screen inventory for this module MUST be wired up — no silent omissions
✅ Use shadcn/ui components only — no custom-styled divs pretending to be components
✅ If a feature needs backend data, call the real endpoint (or stub endpoint) — no hardcoded fake arrays in JSX
✅ Forms must validate (react-hook-form + zod) before submitting
✅ Do NOT spend more than ~10% of session time on how something looks
✅ Flag any feature from the screen inventory that was intentionally skipped and WHY in the state block
```

### Commit message format
```
feat(attendance): add GPS haversine validation with 100m threshold
fix(users): resolve refresh token rotation race condition  
chore(schema): add college_id index to attendance_records
docs(adr): ADR-004 — Qdrant over Chroma for vector storage
```
